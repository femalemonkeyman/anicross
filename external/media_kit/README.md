### Brief Start

```dart
import 'package:media_kit/media_kit.dart';

/// Create a new [Player] instance.
final player = Player();

...
/// Open some [Media] for playback.
await player.open(
  Playlist(
    [
      Media('file:///C:/Users/Hitesh/Music/Sample.MP3'),
      Media('file:///C:/Users/Hitesh/Video/Sample.MKV'),
      Media('https://www.example.com/sample.mp4'),
      Media('rtsp://www.example.com/live'),
    ],
  ),
);

...
/// Modify speed, pitch, volume or shuffle state.
player.rate = 1.0;
player.pitch = 1.2;
player.volume = 50.0;
player.shuffle = false;

...
/// Play / Pause
player.play();
player.pause();
player.playOrPause();

...
/// Release allocated resources back to the system.
player.dispose();

...
/// Subscribe to events.
player.streams.playlist.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  print(event);
});
player.streams.playlist.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  print(event);
});
player.streams.position.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  print(event);
});
player.streams.duration.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  print(event);
});
player.streams.audioBitrate.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  if (event != null) {
    print('${event ~/ 1000} KB/s');
  }
});
```

### Detailed Guide

_TODO:_

_Improvements to the documentation are welcomed. This is very-hard for me alone. ðŸ’–_

## Goals

The primary goal of [package:media_kit](https://github.com/alexmercerind/media_kit) is to become a **strong, stable, feature-proof & modular** media playback library for Flutter. The idea is to support both **audio & video playback**.

[package:media_kit](https://github.com/alexmercerind/media_kit) makes rendering [**hardware accelerated video playback**](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/issues/345) possible in Flutter.

Since, targetting multiple features at once & bundling redundant native libraries can result in increased bundle size of the application, you can manually select the native libraries you want to bundle, depending upon your use-case. Currently, the scope of work is limited to Windows & Linux. The code is architectured to support multiple platforms & features. Support for more platforms will be added in future.

## Support

If you find [package:media_kit](https://github.com/alexmercerind/media_kit) package(s) useful or want to support future development, please consider supporting me. It's a very tedious process to write code, document, maintain & provide support for free. Since this is first of a kind project, it takes a lot of time to experiment & develop.
